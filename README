Mail/Transport/Dbx version 0.01
===============================

Mail::Transport::Dbx is a wrapper around libdbx to read Outlook Express
mailboxes (more commonly known as .dbx files). It relies on a patched 
version of libdbx to make it work on big-endian machines (like Solaris).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you happen to be using ActiveState's Perl under Windows, you can install
this module using ppm. You have to set the repository:

    ppm> set repository sourceforge http://mail-mboxparser.sourceforge.net/ppm
    ppm> install Mail-Transport-Dbx[-580]

If you are using ActivePerl 5.8.0 you have to append '-580' as 5.8.0 is no
longer binary-compatible with older perls.

In case of problems, read on.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    None but you need a working C compiler.

PROBLEMS:

Compilation:
------------
As of v0.02, Mail::Transport::Dbx also supports suncc and MS VisualC.

Solaris:
--------
For suncc you might need to 

  perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-Xa
  make
  make test
  make install

instead of the ordinary 'perl Makefile.PL'. This will put suncc into ANSI 
mode.
      
Windows:
--------
Tested both on ActiveState's 5.6.1 and 5.8.0beta release. Should compile out 
of the box.

Other platforms:
----------------
Please let me know if you are using a platform not mentioned here and 
encounter problems.
