PROBLEMS:

Compilation:
------------
As of v0.02, Mail::Transport::Dbx also supports suncc and MS VisualC.

Solaris:
--------
For suncc you might need to 

  perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-Xa
  make
  make test
  make install

instead of the ordinary 'perl Makefile.PL'. This will put suncc into ANSI 
mode.
      
Windows:
--------
Tested both on ActiveState's 5.6.1 and 5.8.0beta release. Should compile out 
of the box. You'll receive a warning during compilation which you can safely
ignore.
