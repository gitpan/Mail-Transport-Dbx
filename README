Mail/Transport/Dbx version 0.03
===============================

Mail::Transport::Dbx is a wrapper around libdbx to read Outlook Express
mailboxes (more commonly known as .dbx files). It relies on a patched 
version of libdbx to make it work on big-endian machines (like Solaris).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

If you happen to be using ActiveState's Perl under Windows, you can (and in
fact should) install this module using ppm. The installation depends on your
ActivePerl version.  For pre-5.8.0 perls:

    C:\> ppm http://mail-mboxparser.sf.net/ppm/Mail-Transport-Dbx.ppm

If you are using Perl5.8.0:

    C:\> ppm http://mail-mboxparser.sf.net/ppm/Mail-Transport-Dbx-580.ppm
    
In case of problems, read on.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    None but you need a working C compiler or 
    ActivePerl under Windows along with a working ppm.

PROBLEMS:

Compilation:
------------
As of v0.02, Mail::Transport::Dbx also supports suncc and MS VisualC.

Solaris:
--------
For suncc you might need to 

  perl Makefile.PL CCFLAGS=-Xa
  make
  make test
  make install

instead of the ordinary 'perl Makefile.PL'. This will put suncc into ANSI 
mode.
      
Windows:
--------
Tested both on ActiveState's 5.6.1 and 5.8.0beta release. Should compile out 
of the box. You'll receive a warning during compilation which you can safely
ignore.

Other platforms:
----------------
Please let me know if you are using a platform not mentioned here and 
encounter problems (or even if not).
