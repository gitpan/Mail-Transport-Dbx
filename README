Mail/Transport/Dbx version 0.01
===============================

Mail::Transport::Dbx is a wrapper around libdbx to read Outlook Express
mailboxes (more commonly known as .dbx files). It relies on a patched 
version of libdbx to make it work on big-endian machines (like Solaris).

INSTALLATION

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install

In case of problems, read on.

DEPENDENCIES

This module requires these other modules and libraries:

    None but you need a working C compiler.

PROBLEMS:

Solaris:
--------
You may experience problems with Solaris' ucbcc compiler. If that is the case
try to compile with gcc. Unfortunately, ExtUtils::MakeMaker doesn't allow
to pass the CC variable so you have to change 'Makefile.PL' and 
'libdbx/Makefile.PL'. See the comments in the call to WriteMakefile().

Compilation might still emit warnings but you can usually ignore them. 
If 'make test' afterwards works there is nothing to worry about.

Windows:
--------
Not yet tested for ActivePerl. I don't expect it to compile out of the box.
If you try you might encounter problems with nmake failing to parse the 
generated Makefile. Once I have a workable version for windows, I'll release
a ppm package.

Other platforms:
----------------
Please let me know when you are using a platform not mentioned here and 
encounter problems.
