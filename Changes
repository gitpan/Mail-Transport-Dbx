    - removed a segfault in header() and body() when as_string() 
      returns undef
    - thinned libdbx/define.h to get rid of useless macros
    - replaced all C++ish comments from libdbx with their C counterparts
    - some tests relied on locales settings and thus were not portable
    - compilation: now compiles on suncc (with -Xa or -Xt set) and VisualC
